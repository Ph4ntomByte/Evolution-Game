## üß™ Development Guide

### 1. UI Design
- Responsive and square-based grid layout
- Works well on 1024x768 resolution and above
- Uses tooltips, icons, and minimalist visual cues

### 2. Game Logic
- Board is dynamically generated based on difficulty
- Game state is stored in matrix structures
- Only essential data is stored; derived data is computed as needed

### 3. Interaction
- Clicking an empty cell: generates a random level 1 tech
- Merging: creates next-level tech and replaces one cell with a new level 1 tech
- Final level (6): clicking removes it and awards points

### 4. Event Handling
- Grid click
- Tooltip hover
- Play/restart button
- Timer expiration
